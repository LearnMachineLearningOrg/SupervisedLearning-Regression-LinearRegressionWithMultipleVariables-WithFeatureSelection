# SupervisedLearning-Regression-LinearRegressionWithMultipleVariables-WithFeatureSelection
This repository consists of implementation of linear regression machine learning algorithm with multiple variables with feature selection

Machine Learning concept being worked on:

1. Linear regression machine learning algorithm falls under supervised learning
2. In Linear regression, we will learn a model based to predict a label's value given a set of features that describe the label
3. In the problems that linear regression machine learning algorithm targets, the value of the label is a real value
4. Examples of the problems that linear regression machine learning algorithm attempts to targets are 
a. Predicting the prices of houses, with mutiple features
b. We will determine the relationship between the features and only features with high confidence are selected 

In this exmple we will perform linear regression to predit the price of the house using multiple features in the dataset.

1. Dataset being used: kc_house_data.csv
2. Features being used: We will determine the relationship between the features and only features with high confidence are selected
3. Label being predicted: price

Python modules being used:

1. os: This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
2. pandas: Pandas provide high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.
3. numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
4. matplotlib: matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
5. sklearn: It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN
6. sklearn.feature_selection: SelectKBest: It is used to select the best features for running the regression
